# Automated Static Website Hosting with Terraform and AWS S3

This repository provides Terraform configurations to automate the setup of a static website hosting environment on AWS S3. It creates an S3 bucket, configures ownership controls, enables public access, uploads website files, and configures website hosting.

## Prerequisites
- AWS Account: You need an AWS account with appropriate permissions to create S3 buckets and configure related resources.
- Terraform Installed: Make sure you have Terraform installed on your local machine.

- This project presents an efficient method for hosting a basic website by leveraging Terraform and Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3. The primary objective was to simplify the deployment process without unnecessary difficulty. Using Terraform, I made a configuration outlining the infrastructure requirements for hosting the website on AWS S3. This Terraform configuration is necessary to set up and configure an S3 bucket for various purposes, such as storing files, hosting a static website, and managing access control and ownership settings. It ensures consistency and repeatability in deploying AWS infrastructure and helps manage resources in a structured manner.
